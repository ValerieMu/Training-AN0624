# Glossary

## API (Application Programming Interface)
A set of rules and definitions that allow software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data structures for accessing the features of a service or application.

## REST (Representational State Transfer)
An architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful applications use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## REST API
An API that adheres to the principles of REST. It typically uses HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and works with stateless requests and responses.

## Endpoint
A specific URL where an API can be accessed by a client application. Each endpoint corresponds to a function or resource in the API.

## HTTP Methods
Standard operations used in RESTful APIs. Common methods include:
- **GET**: Retrieve data from a server.
- **POST**: Send data to a server to create a new resource.
- **PUT**: Update an existing resource on a server.
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource from a server.

## JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. Widely used in REST APIs.

## XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. Another common format for REST API responses.

## API Key
A unique identifier used to authenticate a client application making a request to an API. Ensures secure access to the API.

## OAuth (Open Authorization)
An open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way to grant websites or applications limited access to user information without exposing passwords.

## Rate Limiting
A mechanism that limits the number of API requests a client can make within a specified time period. Helps prevent abuse and ensures fair usage of resources.

## MuleSoft
A software company that provides integration software for connecting applications, data, and devices. Known for its Anypoint Platform which allows businesses to build and manage APIs and integrations.

## Anypoint Platform
MuleSoft's unified integration platform for connecting any application, data source, or API, whether in the cloud or on-premises. It includes tools for designing, building, and managing APIs and integrations.

## Mule Runtime Engine
The core of MuleSoft's Anypoint Platform. It executes the designed integrations and APIs, enabling communication between applications.

## Connector
In MuleSoft, a pre-built component that enables interaction with a specific external system or service. Connectors simplify the process of integrating different systems.

## DataWeave
MuleSoft's powerful expression language for transforming data between different formats and structures. Used within the Anypoint Platform for data transformation tasks.

## Flow
A sequence of processing steps in MuleSoft's Anypoint Studio. Flows define how messages are processed from source to destination.

## API Gateway
A server that acts as an API front-end, receiving API requests, enforcing throttling and security policies, passing requests to the backend service, and then passing the response back to the requester.

## Integration Pattern
A design that describes how multiple systems or components should interact to achieve a particular objective. Common integration patterns include messaging, file transfer, and shared databases.

## Middleware
Software that provides common services and capabilities to applications outside of what's offered by the operating system. It enables communication and data management for distributed applications.

## SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
A protocol for exchanging structured information in web services using XML. It allows applications to communicate over the internet, typically using HTTP or SMTP.

## Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
An architectural pattern in which software components provide services to other components via a network. Each service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely.

## Microservices
An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. Each service is fine-grained and performs a single function.

## API Lifecycle
The stages an API goes through from creation to retirement. These stages include planning, designing, developing, testing, deploying, managing, and versioning.

## Webhook
A method that allows one application to send real-time data to another application as soon as an event occurs. Webhooks are typically used for event notifications.

## SDK (Software Development Kit)
A collection of software development tools, libraries, documentation, and code samples that developers can use to build applications for a specific platform or service.

## SLA (Service Level Agreement)
A contract between a service provider and a customer that specifies the level of service expected during the contract term. It includes metrics such as uptime, response time, and issue resolution time.
